# Chat Bot using the ChatGPT API
In this project I have used Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Firebase to create a super light application that uses the current ChatGPT test APIs. I have used Next Auth for login, currently only supporting Google user login.

To re-use the code you need to set up your own instance of Firebase and some minor configs around Google login and an API key with OpenAI.
